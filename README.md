# Lab 0 -- Getting Started with Python, PyCharm, and GitHub
Due: 9/12/24

## Purpose:  

This assignment is aimed at giving you experience with the lab environment, with pair programming, using the Interactive Development Environment (IDE) [PyCharm], and writing, debugging, and running a simple Python program.

## Problem: 

Write a program that introduces you and your partner to the class. 

### Details: 

You will write your program in the **pair programming** mode -- one of you is the driver while the other is the navigator.  Once the first driver has written the statements about their partner, switch roles. Remember that the navigator (e.g. the person not currently the driver) is helping with determining what code should be written. The steps below match the tutorial, and the GitHub Quick Guide on Moodle. You may need to reference both.

It is assumed that you have both already clicked on the link on Moodle to get access to your Lab0 repository. The first person createst the team name (last names of participants) and the second person joins that team.

### Steps:

#### Driver 1 Writes Code:

1.	**CLONE REPOSITORY**: Open PyCharm and follow the steps in the **GitHub Quick Guide** document for **Starting an Assignment** to create and clone your Lab0 repository. The Quick Guide document is on Moodle under **General Resources**.

2.	**START FILE**: There are no python files in your repository yet. In PyCharm, in order to create a new Python source code file, be sure you have the Lab 0 folder highlighted in the left side frame tool window. Then, right-click this folder and choose New->Python File from the available menu. Name your new file "Lab0.py" and click "OK." If you are asked if you want to add the file to Git, click "Yes." However, don't click yes to adding any other file it asks you about -- only click "yes" about the file you just created.

3.	**CODE**: Write code in your Lab0.py file. First type  `print ("CS151 Lab 0")` into the file, like in the video.

4.	**RUN and TEST**: Run your program by clicking on the "Run" menu, then choosing "Run" from the drop down menu. Note that once you complete this step once, you can instead click on the green arrow at the top right. Look at the output at the bottom of PyCharm. Does it appear the way you want? If not, or if instead you see an error, try to fix your code so that it does what you want (you will need to run again afterward).

5. **CONTINUE CODING**: Now, write code to output the name of your partner, and then output 5 separate statements about your lab partner so that they also appear at the bottom of PyCharm when the file is run. Your lab partner (e.g. the current Navigator) should tell you want to write about them. 
  * Try to be creative in your statements. 
  * This step should involve 6 print statements.

5.	**RUN and TEST**: Run your code again and make sure it is working correctly, i.e. showing your partner's name and then the 5 separate print statements about them. 

6. **COMMIT And PUSH**: Commit and push your code to github.com. Follow the directions in the "GitHub Quick Guide" document for "Saving Your Work."

#### Driver 2 Writes Code:

7. It is now driver 2's turn to write the code.

8. You should see the Lab0.py file that driver 1 created and the code still there from the prior steps. It is now time to write code about driver 1. Driver 2 should create 6 print statements: 1 that outputs the name of their partner, and the other 5 that each say something about driver 1. Driver 1 is now the navigator, and should supply the information to be added to the print statements.

9.  **RUN and TEST**: Run your program by clicking on the "Run" menu, then choosing "Run" from the drop down menu. Note that once you complete this step once, you can instead click on the green arrow at the top right. Look at the output at the bottom of PyCharm. Does it appear the way you want? If not, or if instead you see an error, try to fix your code so that it does what you want (you will need to run again afterward).

10.	**COMMENT**: Comments are part of the Python file but not part of the code. They are used to explain how the code works to human readers of the code.  Once your program runs properly, add introductory comments at the very top of your file that match the ones below but are edited to be personalized to you and your partner (**replace the brackets and the text in the brackets with what the text in the brackets asks for**). The comments will appear as a different color in PyCharm (light grey). Make sure the program runs correctly after the comments are inserted, and that you understand what is being said in each line of the comments.
  ```
  # Programmers:  [your names here]
  # Course:  CS151, Dr. Isaacman  
  # Due Date: 9/12/24
  # Lab Assignment: 0
  # Problem Statement:  Output information about the programmers
  # Data In: None, there is no user input in this program
  # Data Out:  The names of the programmers and five statements about each of them
  # Credits: [Is your code based on an example in the book, in class, or something else?  
              Reminder: you should never take code from the Internet or another person.]
  ```

11.	Once you are done in lab, even if you havenâ€™t finished the assignment yet, you need to Commit and Push your changes. Follow the directions in the "GitHub Quick Guide" document for "Saving Your Work."
12.	Show your program running on to the professor before leaving the classroom. If class is over but you haven't finished, work on your own time. Finish before due date.

### What to Submit:

1.	Commit & Push your repository to GitHub. It should include a Lab0.py with all requested lines of code and the introductory comments at the very top. Go to GitHub.com to check that it worked. (1 file per pair)
2.	Each partner should independently write a short (around 200 words) reflection of what they learned in Lab 0, and what it was like working with their partner. Submit to Moodle under the Lab0 assignment.
